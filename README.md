System name: Content Creator Production Management Tool

Hi there, we are creating a management tool to help content creator to manage their workflows. Our inspiration and idea desciption are stated below:

> 1. Idea inspiration
  - there is no one-stop management tool for content creators to manage their content production, schedules and communications with third-parties.
  - content creators struggle to manage their daily tasks, but there are no companies that target them as a market (maybe due to low return on investment)

> 2. Functions descriptions

  2.1 Content draft management
  
      - allow content creators to draft their contents and ideas using templated text editing tools (google doc)
      
      - allow content creators to access their contents production sites in one platform (eg: link to canva project, video editing project, ...)
      
      - connect the production with drafts to track progress of each idea
    
  2.2 Upload management
      - allow content creators to post the same content on different social media platforms using one tool
      - allow content creators to shedule post of contents
      
  2.3 Performance tracking
      - allow content creators to trace the performance analysis of contents from each platform
  
  2.4 Communication tracking
      - allow content creators to check communication histories according to sponsors and collaborators
      - allow content creators to reply emails
      - allow content creators to link communication histories with events created in calendar for easy modification of event details
      - allow content creators to create checklist of tasks or events created in calendar for each sponsor to track progress of collaborations
    
  2.5 Schedule management
      - allow content creators to create events
      - allow content creators to arrange their schedules

> 3. Limitations
  - Implementation of instagram and facebook login requires a business verification, so it cannot be done on individual projects like this
  - Due to limitation of time, we were not able to implement all functions, especially the ones that require external services
